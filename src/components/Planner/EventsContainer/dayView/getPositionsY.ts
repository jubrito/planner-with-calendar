/**
 * Function to get a fixed position of the event
 *
 * Instead of creating events with the exact position that was selected,
 * if endOrStartOf15MinBlock is start, it gets the beggining of the hour
 * based on the fifteenMinBlock
 *
 * Example: If hour is 0 and block is 1, and we want to get the relative fixed
 * position, we multiply the fifteenMinBlock (1) with the size of each 15 min block (12.5)
 * to get 12.5 (which is the start of the first block). So regardless of the relativeY,
 * we calculate the relative Y fixed position based on the block (which took relativeY
 * into consideration). If we want to calculate for the hour 1, we need to add the previous
 * hours heights (in this case hour 0), thus we add 'hour (1) * sizeOfAnHour (12.5 * 4)' on top
 * When we want to get the end of the fifteenMinBlock, we need to add another fifteenMinBlock
 *
 * @param block
 * @param endOrStartOf15MinBlock
 * @returns fixedRelativeY â€“ the fixed position to fit in the closest fifteen minute block position
